# Configuration Parameters

These are the parameters accepted for this script. From `v1.0.0`, only PostgreSQL and `TZ` must still be configured via environment variables. All other configuration values are managed through the browser Setup Wizard and stored in the database. For compatibility with older installations, environment variables are imported into the database automatically on first startup. The Setup Wizard is the landing page on a clean installation and is also available later from the menu under Administration > Setup Wizard.

These parameters can be left as-is:

| Parameter               | Description                                  | Default Value     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `CLEANING_SAFETY_LIMIT` | Max unbound-on-every-server albums listed in the cleaning report. It caps the report only; whether orphan catalogue rows are actually deleted is decided by `CLEANING_CATALOGUE` | `100`             |
| `CLEANING_CATALOGUE`    | When `true`, cleaning also DELETES catalogue rows bound to no server (orphans). When `false` it only unbinds each server's stale mappings and leaves the catalogue untouched. The cleaning page has a per-run checkbox to enable it for a single run without changing this default. | `false` |
| `SWEEP_PRUNE_MIN_FETCH_RATIO` | A sweep/cleaning prune is refused when the server returns fewer than this fraction of the tracks it still has mapped, so a partial fetch cannot wipe the mappings. Lower it only to prune a library that legitimately shrank that much. | `0.5` |
| `MUSIC_LIBRARIES`       | Comma-separated list of music libraries/folders for analysis. If empty, all libraries/folders are scanned. For Lyrion: Use folder paths like "/music/myfolder". For Navidrome/Jellyfin: Use library/folder names. | `""` (empty - scan all) |
| `ENABLE_PROXY_FIX` | Enable Proxy Fix for Flask when behind a reverse proxy. Example Nginx configuration: [config.py](https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI/blob/main/config.py#L918) | `false` |
| `DASHBOARD_BROWSE_PAGE_SIZE` | Rows per page in the Song/Artist/Album browse view opened from the dashboard.                | `100` |
| `DASHBOARD_BROWSE_MAX_OFFSET` | Deepest OFFSET a browse query may reach. Past this the API stops paging and asks you to refine with search/filters, so a 1M-row catalogue cannot be hit with a pathological deep-page scan. | `50000` |
| `TZ`     | Set the time zone of all containers (Flask, worker and PostgreSQL) | `UTC` |

These are the default parameters used when launching analysis or clustering tasks. You can change them directly in the front-end.

| Parameter                                   | Description                                                                                                                | Default Value   |

| `CLAP_ENABLED`                              | If false disable CLAP model during the analysis and the use of Text Search functionality.                                  | `true` |
| `CLAP_PYTHON_MULTITHREADS`                  | CPU threading for CLAP analysis. False (default) = Use ONNX internal threading (recommended). True = Use Python ThreadPoolExecutor  | `false`         |
| `PER_SONG_MODEL_RELOAD`                     | Model reloading strategy. true (default) = Unload MusiCNN and CLAP after each song (stable VRAM, slower). false = MusiCNN reloads every 20 songs, CLAP at album end (faster but may accumulate VRAM) | `true`          |
| `MUSICNN_BATCH_SIZE`                        | Max spectrogram patches per MusiCNN embedding inference call. Small batches keep peak RAM/VRAM flat on long tracks. 0 = whole track in one batch (previous behavior) | `8`             |
| **Analysis General**                        |                                                                                                                            |                 |
| `NUM_RECENT_ALBUMS`                         | Number of recent albums to scan (0 for all).                                                                              | `0`             |
| `TOP_N_MOODS`                               | Number of top moods per track for feature vector.                                                                         | `5`             |
| `ANALYSIS_MONITOR_DB_INTERVAL`              | Min seconds between DB child-status reconciliations in the analysis monitor (0 = every poll; active jobs still drain via the queue on every poll). | `10` |
| `ANALYSIS_STALL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`            | Last-resort safety valve for analysis, the twin of `CLUSTERING_STALL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`: minutes during which no album finished, none failed, and no running album advanced even one track, before the parent gives up on the albums it is waiting for and finishes. They are counted as failed albums in the run summary. The window restarts at every sign of life, so a merely slow album never trips it. `0` = never give up. | `60` |
| `ANALYSIS_MAX_STALL_GIVE_UPS`               | How many times one analysis run may give up on a wedged album before it stops dispatching new albums and finishes with what it has analysed. The analysis counterpart of `CLUSTERING_EARLY_STOP_BATCHES`: without it a worker that wedges on every album it claims makes the run last one `ANALYSIS_STALL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` window per album, forever. `0` = no bound. | `3` |
| `INDEX_BUILD_WORKERS`                       | Worker processes for the CPU-bound parts of a similarity index rebuild (the per-artist GMM fits). `0` = auto (half the cores, capped at 8); `1` = fit in-process. | `0` |
| `CATALOGUE_ID_SCHEME_VERSION`               | Version of the `fp_<n>` content-id scheme. New ids are minted at this version and the startup migration relabels every older-version id up to it exactly once. Bump it only to force a one-time catalogue re-migration. | `4` |
| `CHROMAPRINT_COLLECTION_ENABLED`            | Compute and store a Chromaprint acoustic fingerprint per analyzed track (needs the fpcalc binary; off if it is missing).    | `true`          |
| `CHROMAPRINT_GATE_ENABLED`                  | Use stored fingerprints as an extra same-recording check in duplicate detection; skipped for any pair missing a print.      | `true`          |
| `CHROMAPRINT_MATCH_THRESHOLD`               | Fraction of matching fingerprint bits at/above which two tracks are the same recording. Higher = split more aggressively.   | `0.95`          |
| **Clustering General**                      |                                                                                                                            |                 |
| `ENABLE_CLUSTERING_EMBEDDINGS`              | Whether to use audio embeddings (True) or score-based features (False) for clustering.                                    | `true`          |
| `CLUSTER_ALGORITHM`                         | Default clustering: `kmeans`, `dbscan`, `gmm`, `spectral`.                                                                | `kmeans`        |
| `MAX_SONGS_PER_CLUSTER`                     | Max songs per generated playlist segment.                                                                                 | `0`             |
| `MAX_SONGS_PER_ARTIST`                      | Max songs from one artist per cluster.                                                                                    | `3`             |
| `MAX_DISTANCE`                              | Normalized distance threshold for tracks in a cluster.                                                                    | `0.5`           |
| `CLUSTERING_RUNS`                           | Iterations for Monte Carlo evolutionary search.                                                                           | `1000`          |
| `TOP_N_CLUSTERING_PLAYLIST`                 | Exact final playlist cap. With the default 10, select two centroid-distant playlists for each of the three most represented genres, then four centroid-distant playlists with distinct non-top genres. | `10`            |
| `MIN_PLAYLIST_SIZE_FOR_TOP_N`               | Min songs a playlist must have to be considered in the first pass of the Top-N selection.                                 | `20`            |
| `CLUSTERING_CLEANING`                       | When true, existing `_automatic` playlists are deleted before the new clusters are created. Set false to preserve old automatic playlists when running clustering. | `true`          |
| `USE_GPU_CLUSTERING`                        | When true enable the use of GPU on K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA and Spectral                                                                | `false`         |
| `CLUSTERING_AUTO_CALIBRATION`               | Automatic parameter discovery: per server, quick probe runs tune cluster count/eps and sampling percentile before the real run. False = always use the configured defaults as-is. | `true`          |
| `CLUSTERING_MAX_PLAYLIST_SONGS`             | Auto-calibration soft target: try to keep generated playlists at or under this many songs (big still beats empty).        | `200`           |
| `CLUSTERING_CALIBRATION_MAX_TRIES`          | Auto-calibration probe runs per server before the real clustering starts.                                                 | `3`             |
| `CLUSTERING_SUBSET_SONGS`                   | Exact number of songs sampled per clustering iteration: stratified by genre, topped up with random songs. Smaller only when the library has fewer songs. | `10000`         |
| `CLUSTERING_EARLY_STOP_BATCHES`             | Finish clustering early after this many consecutive batches that brought back nothing better, keeping the best result found so far (running batches still complete; no new ones are enqueued). A batch that crashed counts as one of them, so this is also how many batch failures end a run: after this many crashes the clustering stops and returns its best result instead of continuing. | `3`             |
| `CLUSTERING_STALL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`          | Last-resort safety valve: minutes during which NOTHING anywhere in a clustering run changed (no batch finished, failed, launched or disappeared, and no running batch advanced even one iteration) before the parent ends the batches a worker is holding and launches the next one. The window restarts at every sign of life, so it is not a per-batch budget: a merely slow batch, or one a fresh worker picked up after the previous worker died, never trips it. `0` = never give up. | `60` |
| `CLUSTERING_MAX_STALL_GIVE_UPS`             | How many times one clustering run may give up on a wedged batch before it stops launching new ones and finishes with its best result. The clustering twin of `ANALYSIS_MAX_STALL_GIVE_UPS`. This used to be fixed at 1, so the first wedged batch ended the whole search and an overnight run of fifty batches could return the result of five. A given-up batch is also counted as failed, so `CLUSTERING_EARLY_STOP_BATCHES` and `CLUSTERING_MAX_FAILED_BATCHES` still end a run whose batches are genuinely all dying. `0` = no bound. | `3` |
| `CLUSTER_NAMING_AI_HISTORY`                 | When true, AI playlist naming also avoids names used in previous clustering runs (name history and existing playlists). False only avoids duplicates within the current run. | `false`         |
| `PLAYLIST_NAME_HISTORY_ROUNDS`              | How many previous clustering rounds (per server) of playlist names AI naming avoids when `CLUSTER_NAMING_AI_HISTORY` is on. | `2`             |
| **Cron Scheduler Retry**                    |                                                                                                                           |                 |
| `CRON_RETRY_MAX_MINUTES`                    | Max minutes a scheduled run that was blocked by a running queue-guard task (analysis, clustering, cleaning, provider migration, sonic fingerprint or any plugin task) waits in the retry list before it is recorded as skipped and not run. | `240`           |
| `CRON_RETRY_INTERVAL_MINUTES`               | How often the cron manager re-attempts blocked scheduled runs while they are inside the retry window. Clamped to stay below `CRON_RETRY_MAX_MINUTES` so a misconfiguration cannot disable retries. | `10`            |
| **Instant Playlist General**                |                                                                                                                           |                 |
| `INSTANT_PLAYLIST_DEFAULT_N_RESULTS`        | Number of songs the instant playlist aims for when the caller sends no count. It is both the value the chat page's "Number of songs" box starts on and the fallback for a direct API call. | `50`            |
| `INSTANT_PLAYLIST_MAX_N_RESULTS`            | Maximum the chat page's "Number of songs" box accepts. Frontend-only: the `/chat/api/chatPlaylist` API enforces no upper bound, so an API caller can ask for more. | `200`           |
| `MAX_SONGS_PER_ARTIST_PLAYLIST`             | Max songs from a single artist in the instant playlist (diversity enforcement).                                           | `5`             |
| `PLAYLIST_ENERGY_ARC`                       | Enable energy-arc shaping for playlist ordering (gentle start -> peak -> cool down).                                       | `false`         |
| **Similarity General**                      |                                                                                                                           |                 |
| `IVF_METRIC`                                | Distance metric used by the similarity index: `angular` (cosine), `euclidean`, or `dot` (inner product). Changing it requires an index rebuild.                                                                                            | `angular`       |
| **Disk-Paged IVF Similarity Index**         |                                                                                                                            |                 |
| `IVF_NPROBE`                                | Number of nearest IVF cells probed per query - the dominant recall/latency knob. Higher = better recall + slower queries.   | `1024`          |
| `IVF_RERANK_OVERFETCH`                      | int8 is the coarse stage: the similarity query over-fetches this multiple of the result pool and re-ranks it with exact float32 (read from the source `embedding` table) so the top-K ordering matches full precision. Higher = more exact tail recall, more per-query float32 reads. | `4`             |
| `IVF_NLIST_MAX`                             | Upper cap on the number of IVF cells (coarse centroids) created at build time. Requires an index rebuild after change.      | `8192`          |
| `IVF_STORAGE_DTYPE`                         | Stored cell-vector precision: `i8` (int8; angular only, euclidean/dot fall back to f16), `f16`, or `f32` (no quantization). Smaller = less RAM and disk I/O; distances are computed directly in that dtype via NumKong (NumPy fallback). Requires an index rebuild after change. | `i8`            |
| `IVF_TRAIN_POINTS_PER_CELL`                 | Target training vectors per cell; the training sample is this × nlist, capped at the library size (FAISS floor ~39). Requires an index rebuild after change. | `50`            |
| `IVF_MAX_CELL_MB`                           | Oversized cells are split at build time so no single stored cell exceeds this many MB. Requires an index rebuild after change. | `12`            |
| `IVF_MAX_PART_SIZE_MB`                      | Hard cap (MB) on every stored BYTEA value (cells and directory parts) in Postgres. Requires an index rebuild after change.  | `50`            |
| `IVF_QUERY_CACHE_MB`                        | Hard cap (MB) on the per-request decoded-vector cache.                                                                      | `128`           |
| `IVF_READ_BATCH_CELLS`                      | Number of cells fetched per database round-trip during a query.                                                            | `16`            |
| `IVF_GLOBAL_CACHE_MB`                       | Hard cap (MB) on the process-wide, cross-request decoded-cell cache shared by all indexes. `0` disables it.                 | `1024`          |
| `IVF_PRELOAD_ALL`                           | When `true`, stream every cell into the global cache at load time (fully in-memory IVF), still bounded by `IVF_GLOBAL_CACHE_MB`. | `false`         |
| `IVF_GLOBAL_CACHE_IDLE_SECONDS`             | Drop the whole global cell cache after this many seconds with no access (frees idle RAM). `0` = never drop.                 | `300`           |
| `IVF_RESULT_CACHE_SECONDS`                  | TTL (seconds) for cached similar-song / max-distance results so repeated identical queries are instant. `0` disables it.    | `300`           |
| `IVF_RESULT_CACHE_MAX`                      | Maximum number of distinct cached query results per result cache.                                                          | `2048`          |
| `IVF_MAX_DISTANCE_NPROBE`                   | Farthest cells probed when computing the max-distance display value (reverse-IVF). `0` or a value ≥ nlist forces an exact full scan. | `256`           |
| `IVF_DISK_CACHE_ENABLED`                    | When `true`, export each index's cells to a local file at load and serve queries via mmap (OS page cache) instead of reading from Postgres per query. `false` = read from Postgres. | `true`          |
| `IVF_DISK_CACHE_IDLE_SECONDS`               | Drop the resident (RSS) pages of every disk-cache mmap after this many seconds with no query (mapping stays; the next query re-faults from disk). Frees idle RAM. `0` = never drop. | `300`           |
| `IVF_LAZY_LOAD_RETRY_SECONDS`               | Only the Flask process loads the indexes at startup; a worker task that queries one (the sonic fingerprint cron) loads it on first query. Minimum seconds between retries when that load finds no index in the database, so a library with no analysis yet is not re-queried on every call. | `60` |
| `SIMILARITY_ELIMINATE_DUPLICATES_DEFAULT`   | It enable the possibility of use the `MAX_SONGS_PER_ARTIST` also in similar song                                          | `true`          |
| `SIMILARITY_RADIUS_DEFAULT`                 | Default behavior for radius similarity mode. When `true`, similarity results may be re-ordered using the radius (bucketed) algorithm for better listening paths. | `true`          |
| **Sonic Fingerprint General**               |                                                                                                                            |                 |
| `SONIC_FINGERPRINT_TOP_N_SONGS`             | Number of most-played/most-recent tracks used as the fingerprint seed pool.                                               | `20`            |
| `SONIC_FINGERPRINT_NEIGHBORS`               | Default number of track for the sonic fingerprint                                                                         | `50`            |
| `SONIC_FINGERPRINT_MAX_SONGS_PER_ALBUM`     | **Navidrome only.** Max tracks a single album may contribute to the fingerprint seed pool, so one large album (e.g. a 100+ track DJ mix) cannot dominate. Other media servers fetch top songs directly and ignore this. | `3`             |
| `SONIC_FINGERPRINT_CRON_PLAYLIST_NAME`      | Name of the playlist the scheduled (cron) sonic fingerprint run creates on the media server. The run looks for this exact name and replaces it in place, so a scheduled run updates one playlist instead of piling up new ones. | `Sonic Fingerprint by AudioMuse-AI` |
| **Song Alchemy General**                     |                                                                                                                            |                 |
| `ALCHEMY_DEFAULT_N_RESULTS`                  | Number of similar songs to return when creating the Alchemy result (default).                                              | `50`            |
| `ALCHEMY_MAX_N_RESULTS`                      | Maximum the Alchemy page's "Number of results" box accepts. Frontend-only: the `/api/alchemy` and radio APIs enforce no upper bound, so an API caller can ask for more. | `200`           |
| `ALCHEMY_TEMPERATURE`                        | Temperature for probabilistic sampling in Song Alchemy (softmax temperature). Use `0.0` for deterministic selection.       | `1.0`           |
| **Similar Song and Song Path Duplicate filtering General** |                                                                                                            |                 |
| `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_COSINE`       | Less than this cosine distance the track is a duplicate.                                                                  | `0.01`          |
| `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_EUCLIDEAN`    | Less than this euclidean distance the track is a duplicate.                                                               | `0.15`          |
| `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_COSINE_LYRICS` | Less than this cosine distance the track is a duplicate, for the SemGrove (Lyrics Search "By Song") and the Song Path in SemGrove mode. Kept separate from the audio threshold because the SemGrove vector is mostly lyrics. | `0.05`          |
| `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_COSINE_LYRICS_TEXT` | Less than this cosine distance the track is a duplicate, for the Lyrics Search "By Text" tab (768-dim lyrics embedding). Also collapses runs of tracks whose lyrics embedding is identical, such as instrumentals. | `0.05` |
| `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_COSINE_LYRICS_AXIS` | Less than this cosine distance the track is a duplicate, for the Lyrics Search "By Axis" tab. `0.0` disables it, which is the default: axis distances are so tightly packed that any positive value removes a large share of genuine results. | `0.0` |
| `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_HYPERBOLIC`   | Less than this **hyperbolic** (arccosh) distance the track is a duplicate, for Hyperbolic search by song and the Geodesic Journey. Not a cosine distance, so the value is roughly thirty times larger than the cosine ones above. | `0.30` |
| `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_COSINE_CLAP`  | Less than this cosine distance the track is a duplicate, for CLAP text search. CLAP is an audio-derived space, so it uses the same value as the audio filter. | `0.01`          |
| `DUPLICATE_DISTANCE_CHECK_LOOKBACK`         | How many previous song need to be checked for duplicate.                                                                  | `1`             |
| `MOOD_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD`                 | Maximum normalized distance for mood similarity filtering. Lower value will give more importance to mood                  | `0.15`          |
| `MOOD_SIMILARITY_ENABLE`                    | Enable or disable mood similarity filtering globally.                                                                     | `false`         |
| `MOOD_SCORE_MATCH_THRESHOLD`                | A 0-1 mood / other-feature score at or above this counts as the tag applying to the track (used by playlist naming and clustering post-processing). | `0.5` |
| **Song Path General**                       |                                                                                                                            |                 |
| `PATH_DISTANCE_METRIC`                      | The distance metric to use for pathfinding. Options: 'angular', 'euclidean'                                               | `angular`       |
| `PATH_DEFAULT_LENGTH`                       | Default number of songs in the path if not specified in the API request                                                   | `25`            |
| `PATH_FIX_SIZE`                             | When `true`, path generation will attempt to produce exactly the requested path length using centroid merging and backfilling. When `false`, the algorithm will perform a single best pick per centroid and may return a shorter path. Can be overridden per-request via the `path_fix_size` query parameter. | `false`         |
| **Evolutionary Clustering & Scoring**      |                                                                                            |                                        |

| `LYRICS_ENABLED`                            | When `false`, the lyrics transcription/embedding step is skipped entirely during analysis. | `true`                                |
| `LYRICS_API_ENABLE`                         | When `true`, fetches lyrics from external APIs (slots 1 & 2) before falling back to Whisper-small ASR transcription. | `true`               |
| `LYRICS_ASR_ENABLE`                         | When `false`, skips the Whisper-small ASR transcription stage entirely. Tracks with no media-server lyrics and no external-API lyrics are marked as instrumental (sentinel embedding) instead of being transcribed. | `true` |
| `LYRICS_MUSICNN_SKIP`                       | When `true`, a MusicNN `instrumental` tag short-circuits lyrics analysis straight to the instrumental sentinel (no media-server / API / ASR lookup). Set `false` to ignore the MusicNN tag and run the full lyrics pipeline on every track regardless. | `true` |
| `LYRICS_API_1_URL_TEMPLATE`                 | URL template for lyrics API slot 1. Use `{artist_param}`, `{title_param}` placeholders. e.g. `https://example.com/api/get?{artist_param}={artist}&{title_param}={title}` | `""` |

| `VAD_VOICE_RECOGNITION`                     | Minimum seconds of voiced audio Silero VAD must detect before a track is sent to the Whisper-small ASR engine for lyric transcription. Tracks below this threshold are treated as instrumental/ambient and skip ASR entirely (the instrumental embedding sentinel is used instead). Use this knob to fine-tune instrumental/ambient song recognition in the lyrics analysis pipeline. Setting it very high (e.g. `1000`) effectively disables ASR transcription for every track, since no song can reach that much voiced audio within the 4-minute analysis clip. | `25` |
| `LYRICS_ASR_BEAM_SIZE`                      | Beam search width for the Whisper-small ASR decoder. 1 = pure greedy (fastest, most error-prone), 2 = sweet spot (catches stuck-loop attractors at ~2× greedy cost), 5 = Whisper-upstream default (max quality, ~5× cost). Each extra beam adds one extra decoder.run per generated token plus its own KV cache (~30-80 MB at a full 30 s chunk). | `5` |
| `LYRICS_ASR_MIN_AVG_LOGPROB`                | General avg_logprob floor for ASR output. Whisper-small's per-chunk avg_logprob is averaged over the track; if the result is below this threshold the transcript is dropped as likely hallucination and the track is treated as instrumental. Values are negative - closer to `0` is stricter (rejects more), more negative is looser (accepts more). `-1.0` is a permissive global floor that catches only truly degenerate transcriptions. | `-1.0` |
| `LYRICS_ASR_NON_ENGLISH_MIN_LOGPROB`        | Additional avg_logprob floor applied only when Whisper reports a non-English language. Whisper-small is English-biased, so legitimate non-English transcriptions (CJK, Cyrillic, Arabic, etc.) naturally score lower in the `-0.5` to `-0.8` range; set this looser than the English floor (more negative) to avoid dropping valid foreign-language lyrics. Raise toward `-0.5` if you see garbage non-English transcriptions slipping through. | `-0.85` |
| `LYRICS_TEXT_MAX_COMPRESSION_RATIO`         | Compression ratio (zlib) used to filter out text that is not real lyrics. Highly repetitive content compresses far more than real lyrics, so text above this ratio is dropped before embedding. Set to `0` to disable the gate. | `15.0` |
| `LYRICS_MIN_CHARS_FOR_EMBEDDING`            | Minimum number of characters a transcript must have for the pipeline to compute a lyrics embedding. Below this the track is treated as having no usable lyrics and gets the instrumental sentinel. Char-based (not word-based) so CJK / Thai / Lao scripts are not spuriously dropped. | `250` |
| `LYRICS_LANG_CONFIDENCE_MIN`                | Minimum langdetect confidence for API / media-server lyrics to be accepted as real lyrics. Below this the text is dropped to the instrumental sentinel rather than letting unidentifiable junk pollute the embedding. Purely a quality gate (embedding is multilingual; no translation is performed). | `0.70` |
| `LYRICS_CJK_SCRIPT_MIN_RATIO`               | Minimum fraction of letters that must be CJK script (Hangul / kana / Han) for lyrics to be treated as genuine CJK regardless of what langdetect reports, letting code-mixed K-pop / J-pop bypass the confidence gate. Set `0` to disable. | `0.10` |
| `LYRICS_GTE_WARMUP_DURATION`                | Duration (seconds) to keep the gte-multilingual-base lyrics-search model loaded after last use. Auto-unloads after this idle period to free RAM. | `300` |
| `SEM_GROVE_WEIGHT_LYRICS`                   | Contribution of the lyrics embedding to the merged SemGrove cosine similarity (squared scale factor, [0.0–1.0]). Requires index rebuild after change. | `0.75` |
| `SEM_GROVE_WEIGHT_AUDIO`                    | Contribution of the MusicNN audio embedding to the merged SemGrove cosine similarity (squared scale factor, [0.0–1.0]). Requires index rebuild after change. | `0.25` |
| **Hyperbolic Explorer**                     |                                                                                            |                                        |
| `HYPERBOLIC_DEFAULT_LIMIT`                  | Default number of tracks returned by a Hyperbolic Explorer query.                         | `50`                                   |
| `HYPERBOLIC_RADIAL_SPREAD`                  | Fraction of the radial range a candidate must move for the roots / niche modes to accept it, so the two modes visibly differ from plain similar. `0` keeps every mode hugging the seed's own radius. | `0.15` |
| `HYPERBOLIC_CANDIDATE_OVERFETCH`            | Candidate over-fetch multiplier before the hyperbolic re-ranking and de-duplication pass (roots / niche radius windows and the similar mode's pre-dedup slice). | `4`                                    |
| `HYPERBOLIC_RADIUS_SCALE`                   | Poincare projection scale. Leave at `0` to auto-calibrate once from the catalogue's real embedding-norm distribution and persist the result; set a number only to pin it manually. | `0` (auto) |
| `HYPERBOLIC_RADIUS_PERCENTILE`              | Percentile of the embedding-norm distribution used when auto-calibrating `HYPERBOLIC_RADIUS_SCALE`. | `95`                          |
| `HYPERBOLIC_TARGET_LEAF_SIZE`               | Below this many tracks a folder (mood, genre, subgenre) stops splitting and lists its tracks directly instead of generating named clusters. | `150`      |
| `HYPERBOLIC_MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE`               | Minimum songs a named cluster must hold to survive the tree build. Smaller clusters are pruned, and a subgenre (or genre) left with none is hidden entirely. | `20` |
| `HYPERBOLIC_TREE_WARMUP_DURATION`           | Seconds the Hyperbolic Explorer tree cache stays loaded after last use. Unlike the other indexes it is a fully materialized object tree, so it is lazy-loaded when the page opens and auto-unloaded after this idle period to free RAM. | `300` |
| `HYPERBOLIC_JOURNEY_DEFAULT_LENGTH`         | Default number of songs in a Geodesic Journey, both endpoints included. Steps are evenly spaced in hyperbolic arc length, so each one covers the same musical distance. | `25`     |
| `HYPERBOLIC_JOURNEY_ANCESTRY_DIVE`          | How much deeper than the true geodesic the walk dips toward the origin, through a bump that is zero at both endpoints. `0` is the exact shortest geodesic (which already bows toward the shared root); higher values buy a longer detour through more general territory. | `0.20` |
| `HYPERBOLIC_JOURNEY_PATH_SAMPLES`           | Samples of the ideal geodesic returned for the Poincare disk drawing. The whole geodesic lies in the 2-plane spanned by its endpoints, so these draw it exactly. | `96`               |
| `HYPERBOLIC_INDEX_CACHE_MB`                 | Process-wide memory cap (MB) for decoded Poincare index cell vectors. The cell directory and coarse centroids stay in memory; cell vectors are decoded on demand and evicted past this cap. | `256` |
| `HYPERBOLIC_JOURNEY_CANDIDATES_PER_STEP`    | Exact nearest candidates the Geodesic Journey pulls from the Poincare index per waypoint before content de-duplication and the per-artist cap. | `60` |
| **Plugin System**                           |                                                                                            |                                        |
| `PLUGINS_ENABLED`                           | Master switch for the plugin subsystem (discovery, loading, admin UI).                    | `true`                                 |
| `PLUGIN_DEFAULT_REPO_URL`                   | Default community catalog (a static Jellyfin-style `manifest.json`).                      | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI-plugins/main/manifest.json` |
| `PLUGIN_MAX_DOWNLOAD_MB`                    | Hard cap (MB) on a downloaded plugin package, to bound the DB blob and the extraction.    | `50`                                   |
| `PLUGIN_ALLOW_PIP`                          | Allow pip-installing plugin requirements into the plugin directory's `_lib`. Auto-disabled on frozen standalone builds, which cannot pip into the bundle. | `true`             |
| `PLUGIN_HTTP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`               | Connect timeout (seconds) for plugin catalog/manifest/download HTTP calls.                | `10`                                   |
| `PLUGIN_HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT`                  | Read timeout (seconds) for plugin catalog/manifest/download HTTP calls.                   | `20`                                   |
| `PLUGIN_HTTP_RETRIES`                       | Retries for a failed plugin download before giving up (exponential backoff).              | `4`                                    |
| `PLUGIN_HTTP_BACKOFF`                       | Backoff factor between plugin download retries. `0.5` with 4 retries waits ~0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4s. | `0.5`                              |
| `PLUGIN_HTTP_FORCE_IPV4`                    | Pin all plugin HTTP traffic to IPv4. Default true because GitHub raw is often unreachable over IPv6 from a container with no IPv6 egress. Set false only on an IPv6-only host. | `true` |
| `PLUGIN_CATALOG_FETCH_WORKERS`              | Concurrency for resolving per-plugin manifests when building the catalog.                 | `8`                                    |
| `PLUGIN_CATALOG_CACHE_TTL`                  | Seconds the catalog's latest-version map is reused to flag "update available" on the Installed tab before a background refresh re-checks the repos. | `900`             |
| `PLUGIN_CATALOG_REFRESH_INTERVAL`           | Seconds between the web process's own background catalog refreshes, so update buttons appear even when nobody opens the Catalog tab. | `3600`               |
| `PLUGIN_BOOT_DB_WAIT_SECONDS`               | How long plugin boot waits for the database to accept connections before giving up.       | `60`                                   |
| `PLUGIN_BOOT_DB_WAIT_INTERVAL`              | Seconds between those database-readiness retries at plugin boot.                          | `2`                                    |


> ⚠️ **The only officially supported model is `qwen3.5:9b` or `qwen3.5:4b` for faster one**. Compatibility testing is done exclusively against it. Other models below were tested and may work, but **use them at your own risk** - issues opened for untested or arbitrary models could be closed. Different models behave differently and outputs vary between runs.

> ℹ️ **The models listed below were tested in the past and will not be retested going forward.** They are documented for reference only.

**Self-hosted (Ollama):** `gemma3:4b`, `ministral-3:3b` (fastest), plus: llama3.1:8b, llama3.2:1b/3b, gemma3:1b, qwen3:0.6b/1.7b, qwen2.5:1.5b, qwen3.5:0.8b/2b, deepseek-r1:1.5b, phi4-mini:3.8b, lfm2.5-thinking:1.2b.

**Cloud, tested March 2026:** `claude-sonnet-4.6` (best), `claude-haiku-4.5`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`. Earlier: mistral:7b, llama3.1:8b, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-1.5-flash-latest.

You can use either an external AI API or self-host with Ollama - deployment example here:

## OpenAI-compatible hosted providers

AudioMuse-AI can use hosted services that expose an OpenAI-compatible chat completions API through the existing `OPENAI` provider. [Atlas Cloud](https://www.atlascloud.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=AudioMuse-AI) is one example: point `OPENAI_SERVER_URL` at its OpenAI-compatible endpoint and keep using a model that has been validated for AudioMuse-AI unless you have tested another model with your library.

Example Atlas Cloud configuration:

```env
AI_MODEL_PROVIDER=OPENAI
OPENAI_SERVER_URL=https://api.atlascloud.ai/v1/chat/completions
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=qwen3.5:9b
OPENAI_API_KEY=<atlas-key>
```
