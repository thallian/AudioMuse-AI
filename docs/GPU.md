# GPU deployment

NVidia GPU **EXPERIMENTAL** support is available for analysis task in the worker process. This can significantly speed up processing of tracks.

We suggest **8GB VRAM** on GPU, with less you can experience the NON BLOCKING OutOFMemory error (that are handled by switching to CPU). The `PER_SONG_MODEL_RELOAD` env variable, that by default is TRUE, help cleaning the memory by entirely reloading the model each time, on the other side it slow the analysis process.


GPU-accelerated clustering is also available through RAPIDS cuML. It can give a **10-30x speedup** on clustering tasks.

**Features:**
- GPU-accelerated KMeans, DBSCAN, and PCA using RAPIDS cuML
- Automatic fallback to CPU if the GPU is unavailable or hits an error
- Works with all existing clustering configurations and parameters
- Compatible with NVIDIA GPUs on CUDA 12.8.1 or later (*)

(*) Older drivers are NOT supported by the published build, but you can try to build your own image as described in https://github.com/NeptuneHub/AudioMuse-AI/issues/265

**To enable GPU clustering:**

1. Use the NVIDIA image (for example `nvidia/cuda:12.8.1-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu22.04`)
2. Set the value in your `.env` file, or in the Setup Wizard:
   ```
   USE_GPU_CLUSTERING=true
   ```
3. Make sure the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed on the host
4. Use the GPU compose file `deployment/docker-compose-nvidia.yaml`. Worker-only GPU examples are kept in `deployment/deprecated/`

**Performance Impact:**
- **KMeans**: 10-50x faster than CPU
- **DBSCAN**: 5-100x faster than CPU
- **PCA**: 10-40x faster than CPU
- **Overall clustering task**: 10-30x speedup for typical workloads (5000 iterations)

**Example:** A clustering task that takes 2-4 hours on CPU may finish in 5-15 minutes on GPU.

**Notes:**
- GMM and Spectral clustering stay on CPU, there is no cuML implementation for them in this build
- GPU clustering is disabled by default (`USE_GPU_CLUSTERING=false`)
- The GPU is also used by the audio analysis models (ONNX inference)
- The index build and the similarity queries are not GPU accelerated; they are IO bound rather than compute bound, see [ALGORITHM](ALGORITHM.md#4-similarity-indexes-disk-paged-ivf)
