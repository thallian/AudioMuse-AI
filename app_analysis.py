"""Flask blueprint for launching library analysis and database cleaning.

Thin route layer that enqueues the long-running main tasks onto the high
priority RQ queue and returns their job id for the UI to poll via the generic
status routes in `app.py`.

Main Features:
* Routes: `/cleaning` page, `/api/analysis/start` (enqueues
  `tasks.analysis.run_analysis_task`) and `/api/cleaning/start`.
* Archives previously successful main tasks to REVOKED on a new start and
  guards against a second concurrent main task via `get_active_main_task`.
