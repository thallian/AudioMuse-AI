"""Golden-vector record/replay test of the real lyrics embedding pipeline.

Feeds fixed fake lyrics through the actual gte-multilingual-base ONNX
embedder and compares the produced vectors against a recorded baseline
using a cosine-similarity threshold.

Main Features:
* Replays lyric embeddings against stored golden vectors.
* Records a fresh baseline when none is present.
