"""The advisory locks the queue depends on, and the properties reviews miss.

Two of these are invisible in a diff. The start lock is deliberately SESSION
scoped because clean_up_previous_main_tasks commits in the middle of the sequence
it guards, so a pg_advisory_xact_lock typo would still pass every other test
while quietly reopening the double-start gap. And the same key is spelled in two
modules on purpose - the queue must serialize against a Flask process still
holding the legacy lock during a rolling upgrade - which only works while the two
numbers agree.

Main Features:
* The queue and the database spell the one start-lock key identically
* The database-side start lock is session scoped, the queue-side one is per txn
* A maintenance process that loses the election does no work at all
* The maintenance lock is released even when a step of the cycle raises
* One retention step blowing up never skips the ones behind it. They share a
  connection and a cycle, so before the guards a failure in any of them cost the
  whole cycle plus the settling cycle after the reconnect; reclaim itself still
  propagates, because a reclaim that cannot run is exactly when the connection
  deserves to be dropped
