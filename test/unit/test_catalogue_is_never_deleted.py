"""The catalogue never deletes a song that is still on a server.

`score` holds one row per distinct recording, keyed by the fp hash of its own
audio, and the row carries the analysis - MusiCNN, CLAP and lyrics embeddings that
cost real compute to produce. So losing ONE server never deletes the row: it is
only unbound from that server (its track_server_map row goes), stays in the
catalogue, and is hidden from that server's results by the availability filter; a
later sweep re-binds it with no re-analysis. Removing a server or migrating
providers change only `track_server_map`.

Three deleters are sanctioned, and each only removes a row whose audio is gone from
every library or already preserved elsewhere:
* the fingerprint canonicalizer's duplicate MERGE, which folds a row into the
  canonical row that already holds the same audio's analysis (nothing lost);
* the cleaning pass, which deletes a row bound to NO server (an orphan) - the file
  is gone from every library, so the analysis is re-created if it ever returns -
  and only when every server was read completely, so an incomplete view can never
  delete a track still on a server;
* the migration orphan purge, which runs only after a migration and deletes only
  rows bound to NO server (false-merge splits plus pre-existing orphans), so the
  catalogue is left clean and each deleted track re-analyzes under its own id.

Main Features:
* Only the canonicalizer merge, the cleaning orphan-delete and the migration orphan
  purge may DELETE FROM score
* embedding / clap_embedding / lyrics_embedding cascade from score, so they are
  covered by the same rule
