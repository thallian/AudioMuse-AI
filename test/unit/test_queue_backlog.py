"""How many jobs are waiting per queue.

The dashboard used to show worker state (busy or idle) and nothing about the
backlog behind those workers, so an operator had no way to tell "the default
queue has 340 albums waiting" from "the queue is empty". ``sql.queue_backlog``
answers exactly that with one cheap aggregate against the same partial index
the claim statement already uses.

A queue with nothing waiting must still be reported as zero, not omitted: the
aggregate only produces a row for queue names that actually have a NEW row, so
the Python side has to fill in the gap or a caller iterating "one card per
queue" silently drops a queue the moment its backlog clears.

Main Features:
* Every queue name from queue_names.QUEUE_NAMES is always represented
* A queue with no pending rows reports zero
* The count comes straight off the recorded query
* Only NEW rows of the requested queue names are ever counted
