"""Dashboard snapshot contract: what the stats blob may and may not say.

Guards the rules the dashboard is built on: every number is either CATALOG or
per-SERVER, a percentage may only reach 100% when the work behind it is
genuinely complete, and the two refresh cadences stay split.

Main Features:
* A failed count is never published as a real zero (it would show "0 analyzed"
  until the next refresh)
* The tautological musicnn "analyzed %" stays out of the payload
* The per-server block travels inside the snapshot, not the request path
* The template cannot regress to a percentage that rounds up into a false 100%
* The FAST counts refresh every 60s; the distribution charts (Genres, Moods,
  Tempo) stay hourly with their own timestamp; neither walks a media server
