"""Orchestrate the media-provider migration as RQ jobs.

Drives the multi-step migration flow whose dry-run and source-refresh phases run
as RQ jobs polled by the UI; delegates track matching to provider_migration_matcher
and reuses the app's core routines under an app context.

Main Features:
* The centralized catalogue is NEVER touched: `score` rows, their canonical fp_2
  ids and their embeddings survive every migration. A provider swap only rewrites
  `track_server_map` for the default server - matched songs get the target's track
  id, unmatched songs are unbound from that server - so no song's analysis is ever
  lost and the similarity indexes stay valid (no rebuild).
* Under an advisory lock, repoints the default server's mappings, refreshes song
  metadata from the new provider, clears the old provider's artist ids, and points
  the music_servers default row at the target.
* Reads target metadata from the migration_target_meta side table and builds
  the old->new id mapping via indexed per-album queries; reloads state after commit.

    of any server, so a migration cannot change it and must never delete it. A song's
    analysis (its MusiCNN, CLAP and lyrics embeddings) is expensive and irreplaceable;
    a provider swap is just a change of where the file happens to live.

    So all a migration does is rewrite `track_server_map` for the default server:
      - matched     -> its provider_track_id becomes the target's id
      - unmatched   -> its mapping row is DROPPED (the song is unbound from this

    An unbound song is hidden from that server's results by the availability filter,
    and if the file ever comes back a sweep re-binds it with no re-analysis.

    This used to DELETE unmatched score rows and REWRITE score.item_id into the target
    provider's track id - the pre-canonicalization design, where item_id WAS the
    provider id. In a union catalogue that destroyed the canonical ids outright, took
