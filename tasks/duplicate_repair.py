"""One-time catalogue duration backfill + duplicate repair at Flask startup.

Every fp_2 content id needs its track LENGTH in score.duration: it is the anchor
of identity confirmation (durations_compatible splits when either side is NULL),
so a row with no duration can never be a duration-confirmed merge target - the
same audio re-added, or the same song on another server (the whole point of the
N:1 track_server_map design), would fail the check and mint a duplicate id. So
this gives EVERY fp_2 row a duration, not only the duplicates.

Upgrade paths, told apart by the shape of score.item_id, all converge here
(no stored flag - a flag in app_config is purged as an unknown key on the next
boot, which made an earlier version run on every restart):

* From < 3.0.0 (item_id are provider ids): the legacy migration
  (fingerprint_canonicalize) relabels to the current scheme AND backfills
  score.duration for every relabelled row in one shot. This step then no-ops.
* From an early 3.0.0 (item_id are ALREADY fp_2): the legacy migration no-ops,
  and THIS step does the work - it backfills the length of every fp_2 row and
  fixes the embedding-only false merges.
* From a later scheme bump (e.g. fp_3 -> fp_4, which tightened the duration
  tolerance): every EXISTING merge is re-confirmed in place at the current
  tolerance and the ones whose files now differ in length by more than it are
  unmapped; the stored length is kept, never dropped. Then the scheme relabel
  bumps every row up (minting the next id on a collision), so it runs once.

The signal is score.duration: a row WITH a duration was already confirmed, a row
with a NULL duration was not. Every fp_2 NULL-duration row is looked at exactly
once. A row mapping ONE file just gets its length stamped. A row mapping MORE
than one file is a merge: real (all lengths agree) keeps its length stamped and
its mappings; false (lengths differ) is unmapped so the next analysis re-analyzes
each file under its own correct id. A single file whose server reports no length
is stamped with a 0 sentinel so the whole catalogue is not re-listed for it on
every boot - 0 behaves exactly like NULL for identity (never confirms a merge)
and a later re-analysis overwrites it with the real length. Durations come from
ONE metadata listing per server (no per-id/batch fetch, no audio downloads),
fetched concurrently across servers. The duration backfill and re-verify never
delete a score or embedding row; the separate migration-only orphan purge does.

Main Features:
* Table-derived, marker-free idempotency via score.duration - instant no-op once
  every row carries a length.
* Backfills the length of EVERY fp_2 row (single-file and duplicate survivors),
  not only duplicates, from the same one whole-catalogue listing per server.
* Duplicate consensus: real groups keep + stamp their length, false groups lose
  only their track_server_map rows; single-file rows are never unmapped.
* Concurrent per-server fetch, progress logs at every ~10%, final summary.
* split_chromaprint_false_merges: cleaning-time Path B - splits a same-server
  duplicate group whose stored Chromaprints prove its files are different
  recordings (skip-if-missing); unmaps only, never deletes a catalogue row.
* purge_orphan_catalogue_rows: migration-only cleanup - deletes every score row
  bound to no server (false-merge splits plus pre-existing orphans), so the
  catalogue is clean after a migration; embeddings cascade, per-file Chromaprints
  are kept, and each deleted track re-analyzes under its own id if its file returns.
  It needs no complete-listing guard (unlike the cleaning pass): it never interprets
  a server listing, only the map table itself, and an unreachable server keeps its
  map rows, so a track still on any server is never purged. The one accepted window
  is a concurrently analyzing track between its score insert and its map flush on
  the migration boot itself - hitting it costs that track one re-analysis, nothing
  more.
