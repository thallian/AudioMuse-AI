"""Build and refresh the user's "radio" playlists on the media server.

Regenerates every enabled alchemy radio by running song_alchemy against each
radio's anchor and pushing the result to the media server.

Main Features:
* Runs ONLINE, inside the Flask process: every radio queries the in-memory
  similarity index, which only Flask loads, so both callers (the Alchemy page
  button and the alchemy_radio cron tick) call this directly instead of queueing
  it to a worker that has no index.
* Generates tracks per radio from its stored anchor, result count, and
  temperature, skipping radios that yield no results.
* Runs against every enabled media server in the requested scope, isolating
  failures so one server cannot abort the others: the cron row passes "all"
  (scheduled work always covers every server) while the Alchemy page passes the
  server picked in the sidebar, since that page is per server.
* Upserts each playlist, falling back to create_playlist when the provider does
  not support create_or_replace_playlist, and returns a created/failed summary.
* Reports progress through an optional ``report`` callback: the cron tick passes
  one that heartbeats its task_status row, so a run that outlives the RQ janitor's
  orphan grace period is not mistaken for a row with nothing behind it.
