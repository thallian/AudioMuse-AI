"""Every way a batch task can block forever, and who unblocks it.

There are exactly five of them (SCENARIOS). Four are generic and live in
taskqueue.maintenance; the fifth, a child whose worker is alive but whose work
never comes back, can only be judged by the parent that is waiting on it. Before
this module each fan-out parent carried its own copy of that judgement and they
DRIFTED: clustering and analysis fixed the same bug in opposite directions, and
three of the four long-opaque-phase tasks were simply never given a heartbeat at
all because nothing listed what a task was supposed to have.

So the judgement lives here once (ChildDrainSupervisor), each task supplies only
the part that is genuinely its own (how to END a child), and RECOVERY records the
stance of EVERY task type on EVERY scenario - including "not applicable", with
the reason. A missing stance is a test failure, not a silence.

Main Features:
* SCENARIOS names the five ways a run blocks: the main task's worker dies, its
  worker lives but its row goes silent, a child's worker dies, a child's worker
  lives but never returns, and the parent giving up over and over forever.
* ChildDrainSupervisor is the ONE implementation of the sliding no-progress
  window, of WHICH children a give-up ends, and of how many give-ups a run gets.
  Both fan-out parents drive it; they differ only in end_child.
* stalled_victims is the victim rule: the children a worker is HOLDING, or every
  live child when nothing is running at all, because then the queue itself is the
  wedge and sparing it hangs the parent forever.
* row_heartbeat answers the sixth thing, which is not a way to block but a way to
  be WRONGLY unblocked: a phase that is one long opaque call writes no row while
  it runs and is indistinguishable from a wedge. It bumps the row from its own
  connection under a lock_timeout, so a task whose own transaction is sitting on
  that row cannot make its heartbeat block instead, and it stops after
  stop_after_minutes so a phase that really never returns still gets caught
  instead of being propped up forever. EVERY caller passes that bound: an
  unbounded heartbeat on a main task is strictly worse than no heartbeat, because
  it holds the one-live-main index open against every other run forever. The
  budget is measured against the clock, not by adding up intervals, so a database
  outage that skips beats cannot quietly extend it either. It bounds ONE step,
  not one `with` block: a caller whose label names the step it is on (the nine
  index builds, naming then creating) restarts the budget every time that label
  changes, so a loop of legitimately slow steps cannot spend a budget sized for
  one of them. That is what lets the budget be short. It is deliberately short -
  _MAX_SLOW_STEP_WINDOWS is 2, not the 6 it started at - because this is
  overnight work: at 6 windows a main task that hung at 23:00 was still holding
  the queue at 20:00 the next day (18h propped up, then the nudge's own limit on
  top). Two windows puts the whole detect-and-clear inside a night, and being
  wrong is cheap: the task is requeued and resumes from its persisted progress.
* RECOVERY maps every task type to its stance on every scenario, so a gap is
  visible in one table instead of being spread over six modules.

This module is imported eagerly by every task that can block, so it deliberately
imports database INSIDE the heartbeat thread rather than at the top: at the top it
put app -> ... -> recovery -> database -> config over the eager-import ceiling
test_import_architecture pins.
