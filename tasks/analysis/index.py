"""Similarity index rebuilds: the visible queue task and the nine build steps.

Main Features:
* _run_all_index_builds: audio IVF (fatal), CLAP text, lyrics, lyrics axes,
  SemGrove, artist similarity, song map, artist map and the Hyperbolic Explorer
  projection backfill + tree build (computed and persisted here, worker-side,
  exactly like the map's UMAP fit - the Flask process only ever loads the
  persisted result via the index-reload NOTIFY, never reclusters); non-fatal
  failures are recorded through the central error registry at WARNING and the
  run continues.
* rebuild_all_indexes_task: the queue entry point, reporting into task_status and
  re-raising on failure so its enqueue-time Retry policy actually fires.
* The shared g.db connection is CLOSED between build steps. A Postgres backend
  never returns memory to the OS while its session lives, so running all nine
  builds on one connection made that single backend accumulate the union of
  every step's peak: measured on a real server, one connection writing 200MB of
  index blobs climbed to 145MB RSS and stayed there, while a fresh connection
  per build peaked at 69MB and released it on close. Recycling costs one cheap
  reconnect per step and keeps Postgres' idle footprint flat after an analysis.
* Every step runs under a row_heartbeat on the task's own row. The wedged-main
  nudge reads task_status.timestamp and nothing else, but a step is ONE opaque
  call that writes no row while it runs, so on a big library the IVF, artist-GMM
  or hyperbolic backfill outlived QUEUE_WEDGED_MAIN_TASK_MINUTES and had a
  perfectly healthy analysis cancelled out from under it. The heartbeat also
  names the running step at WARNING each time it fires, so a step that really is
  stuck is loud rather than silent. It bumps from this process, so a worker that
  actually dies stops bumping and reclaim still takes the row, and it is BOUNDED:
  a build that never returns stops being propped up after several windows, or the
  nudge could never fire and one wedged rebuild would lock out every main task.
* After the nine builds finish, the worker issues a CHECKPOINT on its own
  connection and closes it. Postgres only releases WAL segments and flushed
  dirty buffers at a checkpoint, so without it the hundreds of MB written as
  index blobs keep the WAL and buffer cache inflated after the run; forcing the
  checkpoint (plus the per-step recycle) leaves Postgres back at its idle floor
  once the worker's child process exits.
