"""Library cleanup task: unbind server mappings for tracks a server no longer has.

Runs as an RQ job. Fetches the current track set of every configured media
server through the sweep's OWN enumeration and pruning
(``multiserver_sync.fetch_server_catalogue`` / ``prune_stale_mappings``, library
filter applied), so the prune baseline can never disagree with the enumeration
that created the mappings, and removes ONLY that server's rows from
track_server_map for tracks it no longer has. The
A song that disappeared from ONE server keeps its analysis, embeddings and
mappings on every other server. A song bound to NO server (an orphan) is
DELETED from the catalogue - it is gone from every library, so its analysis is
removed and simply re-created if the file ever returns. That delete happens
ONLY when every server was read completely (none failed, empty or partial), so
an incomplete view can never delete a track still on a server. Every cleaning
run then runs the SAME full similarity-index rebuild analysis runs, INLINE, and
is not reported complete until the indexes reflect the cleaned catalogue and the
'reload' has been published so a running Flask swaps the new indexes in.

Main Features:
* identify_and_clean_orphaned_albums_task: the RQ entry point that fetches each
  server's tracks, prunes that server's stale mappings, and deletes the tracks
  left bound to no server.
* Reuses the sweep's public helpers rather than re-implementing the fetch and
  the prune, so cleaning and the sweep can never drift apart.
* Refreshes each server's stored library size (``music_servers.track_count``)
  from the fetch it already performs, keeping the dashboard's coverage
  denominator current on every cleaning run.
* Deletes catalogue tracks bound to no server, but only when every server was
  read completely; otherwise it just reports them and deletes nothing.
* Runs the Chromaprint dedup (Path B) each time: splits merged duplicate groups
  whose stored fingerprints prove they are different recordings, so a false merge
  is corrected once its files have Chromaprints (skip-if-missing, unmap-only).
* Runs the shared _run_all_index_builds inline at the end of every run, the same
  final rebuild analysis performs, so the task completes only once the similarity
  indexes are consistent with the catalogue on every music server and Flask has
  been told to reload them.
