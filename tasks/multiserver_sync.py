"""The sweep: alignment of the analyzed catalogue with media servers.

The ONLY place that walks a server's whole catalogue to reconcile it with the
analyzed database - analysis never sweeps, it only aligns the tracks it
actually analyzes. A sweep is a pure metadata pass, NEVER a download or an
analysis: track mappings via normalized path, path tail, and metadata tiers,
plus the server's artist links and a set-based catalogue metadata refresh. It
runs automatically the moment a server is added or its matching-relevant
settings change, and from the Align button.

Runs as an RQ job on the high-priority queue (a main task, like analysis and
clustering coordinators, so album jobs on the default queue can never starve
it) and reports progress into ``task_status`` (task type ``server_sweep``);
cancellable via the standard /api/cancel endpoint (cooperative checks).
Unmatched tracks are simply left unmapped - the analyzed catalogue is never
touched or reduced. Already-mapped tracks are skipped, so re-sweeps are
incremental. Catalogue fetches run bound to the target server so its own
library filter applies, and a full-refresh sweep (the add-server and manual
align actions) prunes mappings whose provider track is no longer on that
server - only map rows are removed, never analyzed tracks.

Main Features:
* ``sweep_server`` / ``sweep_all_secondary_servers`` RQ entry points with live
  percentage progress, one-line status, and cooperative cancellation.
* ``fetch_server_catalogue`` / ``prune_stale_mappings`` / ``unmapped_local_count``
  are the public helpers this module owns; the cleaning task reuses them instead
  of re-implementing the fetch and the prune, so the two can never drift apart.
* Zero-download alignment: matching from catalogue metadata only.
* Artist links: each swept server's ``artist_server_map`` rows are upserted
  from its fetched catalogue.
* Catalogue metadata refresh: album, album artist, year and rating are
  batch-updated for every track mapped to the swept server; ``file_path``
  only from the default server (it is the matcher's top-priority tier).
* Lean memory: the fetched target catalogue is condensed into a slim
  CandidateIndex right after the fetch (its metadata staged into a temp
  table), and the local catalogue streams through it in keyset-paginated
  chunks with per-chunk upserts, so the local side is never fully
  materialized.
* ``recover_abandoned_sweeps`` (run by the RQ janitor) revokes sweeps whose RQ
  job died mid-run - e.g. killed by the worker restart a default-server change
  publishes - and enqueues one matching-only replacement alignment of all
  servers, at most once per 10 minutes; rows with no RQ job at all (enqueue
  failures) are left to the batch-start cleanup.
* Empty-catalogue guard: while nothing is analyzed yet every sweep completes
  instantly without fetching, so first-install server adds and restarts cost
  nothing; the first analysis creates the mappings itself.
* Per-server library sizes are NOT owned here: the dashboard's snapshot
  refresher counts every server's catalogue at Flask startup and hourly;
  sweeps and cleaning just keep ``track_count`` fresh from fetches they
  already perform.
* Full-refresh sweeps re-fetch even aligned servers and prune stale mappings so
  per-server counts stay truthful; pruning is skipped when the fetch looks
  partial so a transient provider error never mass-deletes valid mappings.

    """Replace alignment sweeps whose RQ job died before finishing.

    A worker restart (for example the one published right after changing the
    default server) can kill a queued or running sweep; RQ later parks the job
    as failed/abandoned while its task_status row stays stuck in PROGRESS and
    the servers it covered are never aligned. Called periodically by the RQ
    janitor: every non-terminal sweep row whose RQ job is dead - or has vanished
    from Redis entirely - is marked REVOKED and one fresh alignment covering all
    servers is enqueued in their place (matching-only, so already-aligned
    servers exit immediately instead of being re-fetched and re-pruned; the
    interrupted server resumes incrementally since mapped tracks are skipped).
    'missing' rows are recovered here rather
    than skipped: the batch-start cleanup no longer touches sweeps (starting an
    analysis used to silently revoke a running one), so nothing else would ever
    retire them and the servers panel would show a phantom sweep stuck at N%.
    Recovery is throttled to once per 10 minutes after a replacement is
    enqueued, so a replacement that itself keeps dying (for example OOM during
    the index rebuild) is not revoked and re-enqueued in a tight loop. Returns
    the replacement task id, or None when nothing was recovered. Uses its own
    raw connection so it needs no Flask app context.

    A main row is written and committed BEFORE its job is enqueued, so a Redis
    outage (or a worker cold-shutdown, or a job TTL expiring) can leave a PENDING
    row with nothing behind it. ``get_active_main_task`` counts that row as a live
    task, so every later Start Analysis / Clustering / Cleaning answers 409, forever
    - and nothing retired those rows: the sweep recovery only handles sweeps, and
    the batch-start cleanup cannot run because the 409 fires first.

    RQ retains failed, stopped, canceled, and finished jobs in terminal registries.
    Fetching such a job therefore proves only that its record still exists, not that
    it is alive. A terminal RQ job whose database row is still non-terminal is
    reconciled to FAILURE, or REVOKED when it was intentionally stopped/canceled.

    Sweeps are excluded: recover_abandoned_sweeps re-enqueues those rather than
    failing them. Inline task types are excluded from the RQ probe too, because
    they NEVER have a job to find: they run inside the Flask process, so probing
    RQ declared a perfectly healthy run dead two minutes in, and the row then
    flipped back to SUCCESS when it finished. They are judged by their heartbeat
    instead - stale for longer than the inline window means the process that owned
    the run is gone without having written a final status.

    Rows younger than the grace period are left alone, so a job that was enqueued
    microseconds after its row is never reaped out from under itself. Returns the
    number of rows finalized. Uses its own raw connection, so it needs no Flask
