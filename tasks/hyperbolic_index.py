"""Disk-paged Poincare IVF index for the Hyperbolic Explorer.

A nearest-neighbour index over the Poincare-projected embeddings, built per
music server and persisted as segmented blobs in ivf_dir (the same storage
pattern the tree cache and the other indexes use). Only the cell directory and
the coarse centroids are held in memory; the projected vectors live on disk and
are decoded cell by cell on demand under a process-wide byte cap, so the full
projected catalogue never stays resident.

Main Features:
* The catalogue is partitioned by HYPERBOLIC k-means (tasks.hyperbolic_geometry
  .poincare_kmeans): k-means++ seeding, assignment and the Frechet-mean centroid
  update all run in the exact Poincare metric, so no Euclidean or cosine step
  enters the partition. Cell count follows the same rule as the other IVF
  indexes, 8*sqrt(n) capped at IVF_NLIST_MAX, and training runs on an
  IVF_TRAIN_POINTS_PER_CELL sample before every track is assigned to its
  nearest centroid.
* This REPLACED a radial-band split, which measured out as useless: radius
  alone cannot separate points in 200 dimensions, because almost all of the
  distance between two tracks comes from direction. On a 200k catalogue the
  band layout still scanned 63-95% of the library per query and adding bands
  barely moved it (8 bands 97.2%, 384 bands 93.8%). A centroid encodes
  direction as well as radius, which is what makes IVF_NPROBE cells out of
  8*sqrt(n) an actual reduction rather than a full scan with extra steps.
* Querying takes the exact Poincare distance to every coarse centroid, probes
  the nearest IVF_NPROBE cells, and heaps the top-k over their members. Like
  every IVF this is approximate: a neighbour parked in an unprobed cell is
  missed, and IVF_NPROBE is the recall/latency knob. Probing N cells would be N
  Postgres round trips, so _prefetch_cells pulls every uncached probed cell in
  ONE ANY() read and hands the arrays straight to the scan. It returns them
  rather than relying on the cell cache to still hold them, because a probe set
  larger than HYPERBOLIC_INDEX_CACHE_MB would otherwise evict its own earlier
  cells during the prefetch and the scan would re-read them one at a time,
  which is the exact round-trip storm the bulk read exists to prevent.
* IVF_NPROBE and _RERANK_OVERFETCH are NOT redundant: IVF_NPROBE decides which
  cells are looked at at all, while the overfetch decides how many of the
  scanned candidates survive i8 ranking error into the exact re-rank. Neither
  covers the other's failure mode.
* Cell vectors are quantized through tasks.ivf_quant on config.IVF_STORAGE_DTYPE
  (default i8), the same knob and the same codec every other index uses, so the
  projected catalogue on disk costs 1 byte per dimension instead of 4. This
  path deliberately does NOT go through ivf_quant.effective_code: that helper
  downgrades i8 to f16 for any non-angular metric, and the Poincare metric is
  non-angular, but the storage dtype here is taken literally so i8 means i8.
  The coarse centroids stay float32, exactly as they do for the paged IVF.
* i8 makes the cell scan coarser here than it would for an angular index,
  because the Poincare metric divides by (1 - ||u||^2), which for a track near
  the ball boundary is ~1e-6 while the i8 grid of 1/127 moves a radius by
  ~1e-2. Two things absorb that. Decoded cells are pushed back inside the ball
  with clip_into_ball, so a quantized point can never land on or past the
  boundary and blow the denominator up. And the scan overfetches
  _RERANK_OVERFETCH-fold (capped at _RERANK_SCAN_CAP) before hyperbolic_nearest
  re-ranks those candidates against the exact float32 poincare_embedding rows,
  so the distances and ordering it returns are exact for everything the probed
  cells reached. Measured on a 60k catalogue, 4x already recovers 100% of the
  exact top-20 and 1x recovers 85%, at every nprobe from 32 to 1024, so the
  factor is set to 8 for margin rather than the 32 the retired radial layout
  needed. Cells are why: a boundary track whose i8 distances are scrambled now
  lands in its own cell instead of polluting every query's global ranking.
  hyperbolic_nearest_multi skips the re-rank on purpose: it is a candidate
  generator whose caller (the geodesic journey) already re-ranks on the exact
  vectors itself.
* Those two callers want OPPOSITE things from the scan width, so they size it
  separately. hyperbolic_nearest wants PRECISION at rank k, and 8x delivers it.
  hyperbolic_nearest_multi wants BREADTH: waypoints along one geodesic are
  near-duplicates of each other, so their top-k lists overlap almost entirely
  and the union collapses to a narrow tube of songs. Sizing it on top-k recall
  starves it - on a 198-step journey 8x yielded 903 distinct candidates where
  64x (_MULTI_OVERFETCH) yields 3776, and a journey that has to fill 198 steps
  from 903 songs runs dry against content-dedup and MAX_SONGS_PER_ARTIST and
  returns a truncated walk. _multi_scan_width is also deliberately independent
  of the storage dtype: breadth is a property of the geodesic, not of i8.
* hyperbolic_nearest_multi is BATCHED over its waypoints rather than looping
  the single-vector search. Waypoints along one geodesic are neighbours, so
  their probe sets overlap almost completely, and looping meant decoding the
  same cells once per waypoint: on a 198-step journey that was ~4s of pure
  repeated decode. It instead takes the union of the probed cells, decodes each
  one ONCE, and scores it against every waypoint that probed it in a single
  hyperbolic_distance_matrix call. Measured 4-6x faster end to end, and the
  candidate pool it returns is a strict superset of what the loop produced.
* hyperbolic_nearest / hyperbolic_nearest_multi return item ids ranked by exact
  Poincare distance, or None when no index is built yet; callers surface that
  as a "run analysis to build it" error instead of scanning the catalogue.
* The index stores ONE union of every server's projected tracks. A request
  scoped to a server filters candidates through the shared availability mask
  from tasks.index_availability, so no per-server copy of the index is built.
  A rebuild also sweeps the blobs of the retired radial-band layout and any
  legacy per-server index, which nothing names any more.
* hyperbolic_nearest_multi applies that mask (and the exclude set) to each
  probed cell's members BEFORE the per-waypoint top-k selection, not after:
  filtering the already-selected top candidates could throw away every
  visible one in favour of ids from another server that merely outrank them
  on raw distance, starving the geodesic journey's candidate pool.
* invalidate_availability_cache clears that mask cache on demand.
  tasks.multiserver_sync calls it (alongside the paged-IVF one) whenever a
  sweep actually removes track_server_map rows, so a server's availability
  view corrects itself immediately instead of waiting out the TTL - it was
  missing that hook until it was found only replaying the 30s poll forever,
  never the event a real membership change already fires for every other
  index.
