"""Resolves the Whisper/ASR backend for the lyrics pipeline.

The default is the built-in ONNX backend (whisper_onnx). A plugin can replace it
by registering an alternative with ``ctx.register_analysis_provider('asr', ...)``
- used, for example, by an AMD/ROCm plugin that swaps in faster-whisper because
MIGraphX cannot run the ONNX Whisper decoder. The replacement must expose the
same public surface: ``load_whisper_model()``, ``transcribe(wav, sr, language=None)``,
``is_loaded()`` and ``unload()``.

``transcribe`` must return a dict with ``text`` (the transcript), ``language``
(the detected language code) and ``avg_logprob`` (the mean per-token log
probability, used to gate transcript quality). A backend that cannot report a
confidence should leave ``avg_logprob`` out entirely: the quality gate is then
skipped instead of reading a value that would drop every transcript.

Main Features:
* Consults the loaded plugins for an 'asr' analysis provider before the built-in
* Falls back to the built-in whisper_onnx backend when no plugin registered one,
  or when the replacement is missing part of the required surface
* Rejection of an incomplete replacement is warned on every resolution, naming
  the owning plugin so the user knows which one to fix or remove
* Swallows any plugin-resolution error so a broken plugin never breaks lyrics
