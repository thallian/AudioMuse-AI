"""Provider-migration Flask blueprint (migration_bp) for switching media servers.

Single add-on entry point for switching the active media-server provider on a
running install: a wizard page at ``/provider-migration`` plus the backing REST
API under ``/api/migration/*``. Target-provider probing runs through
``tasks.provider_probe`` and the long migration through the high-priority queue.

Main Features:
* Full wizard flow: session start, probe test, library select, album search,
  source-path refresh, dry-run, manual match/skip, finalize, and execute, with
  status polling for the async queue jobs.
* Target credentials stay in ``migration_session.target_creds`` (never read
  from ``config``), so the live provider keeps working throughout; a successful
  execute writes the new settings to ``app_config`` and restarts via
  ``restart_manager``. ``provider_probe`` is lazily imported to avoid loading
  ``tasks/__init__.py`` at module import.
