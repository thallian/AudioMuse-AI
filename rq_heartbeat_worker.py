"""Worker class selection, with a heartbeat that keeps long jobs alive on Windows
and re-registers a worker that a transient Redis outage silently deregistered.

RQ's forking ``Worker`` refreshes a running job's started-registry score from its
monitor loop. ``SimpleWorker`` (the only option on Windows, which cannot fork) has no
monitor loop, so that score is written once as ``now + DEFAULT_WORKER_TTL`` (420s) and
then goes stale even for ``job_timeout=-1``, and the janitor's
``started_registry.cleanup()`` re-queues or fails every job running longer than seven
minutes. The Windows heartbeat must NOT be replaced by returning -1 from
get_heartbeat_ttl: Execution.save would then EXPIRE the key with a negative TTL,
deleting it the instant the job starts.

Issue #784: when Redis is unreachable longer than the worker-key TTL the key expires and
clean_worker_registry SREMs the worker from ``rq:workers``; register() runs once at
birth, so the live worker keeps taking jobs while invisible to the dashboard - no rq
release through 2.10 re-adds it. The mixin re-runs register() after every heartbeat,
clears any ``death`` a janitor stamped on a worker that had not actually gone away, and
re-EXPIREs the key so it regains a TTL even on rq 2.7, whose heartbeat recreates an
expired key without one (the noavx2 image stays on that pin). The repair runs on the
worker's own pipeline only: rq's maintain_heartbeats reads the pipeline it hands to
heartbeat positionally, so queueing extra commands there would make rq inspect the
wrong result. rq itself rebuilds a recreated key's hash content only on the mid-job
path (maintain_heartbeats, since 2.9), so when the key lost its identity while the
worker sat idle the repair rewrites it from rq's own serialize(); rq 2.7 has no
Worker.serialize(), so on the noavx2 pin the hash stays partial until restart, which
is accepted.

The Windows beat thread shares a lock with execution preparation and cleanup, so a beat
can neither see an execution before its transaction commits nor outlive the cleanup that
deletes it, and execute_job does not return until the thread exits, so a blocked beat
cannot cross into the next job. A beat that finds no execution refreshes the worker key
alone rather than returning empty-handed; there is no execution to beat, but the worker
key is the worker's own and is always safe to renew.

Main Features:
* ReregisterOnHeartbeatMixin: SADDs the worker back into rq:workers after every
  heartbeat, clears false death stamps, re-EXPIREs the worker key, and restores
  identity lost to an idle-time outage from rq's own serialize().
* Both worker classes re-check the config hydration before each job, so a worker
  that booted before Postgres was reachable heals at the first job boundary (the
  database is provably up then: Flask just enqueued the job) instead of running
  on env-only values for its whole life; a healthy boot skips it in two flag
  reads. The worker is marked BUSY before the re-check: rq's warm shutdown
  raises StopRequested only on an idle worker, and the reload's exception guards
  would swallow it - BUSY makes a signal during the re-check defer until after
  the job instead of vanishing.
* HeartbeatSimpleWorker: runs perform_job on the main thread while a daemon thread
  calls maintain_heartbeats, giving SimpleWorker the liveness signal the forking
  worker gets for free; also carries the re-registration mixin.
* The beat thread is serialized with execution setup and cleanup, keeps the worker key
  alive across both, and logs genuine Redis failures instead of dying.
* WorkerClass: HeartbeatSimpleWorker on win32, a re-registering forking Worker elsewhere.
