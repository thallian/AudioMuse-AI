"""The one LISTEN/NOTIFY loop, shared by the workers, the control listener and Flask.

Postgres delivers a NOTIFY to every session currently listening on the channel,
across processes and across containers. That broadcast property is what lets one
Flask container reach N worker containers with a cancel or a restart request and
no broker in between.

The connection is dedicated and autocommit, never borrowed from the pool or from
Flask's ``g``: a listening session sits blocked in ``select()`` most of the time,
so sharing it with query traffic would stall both. It is also the session whose
``application_name`` identifies this process in ``pg_stat_activity``, which is
the only worker registry the queue has.

A notification is a wake-up, never data. Payloads are a queue name or a task id,
because Postgres caps a NOTIFY payload at 8000 bytes and because the row in
``task_status`` is already the authority on what to do. Losing a notification
therefore costs latency and nothing else, which is why the poll fallback in the
worker can be as slow as ``QUEUE_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` without risking a
stuck queue.

Main Features:
* ``Listener`` owns a dedicated autocommit connection and reconnects on drop
* Blocks in ``select()`` so an idle worker costs no queries at all
* Dispatches ``(channel, payload)`` to a callback on the listener thread
* ``on_ready`` runs once per (re)connection, for callers that must re-check
  state they could not be notified about while they were disconnected
