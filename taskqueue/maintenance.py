"""Reclaims tasks whose worker died and finishes rows whose owner cannot.

Orphan detection needs no heartbeat or registry: a task is orphaned when its row
says RUNNING and nobody holds its advisory lock, which died with the worker's
connection. A task restarts ONLY because its worker died, at most
QUEUE_MAX_ATTEMPTS times, then fails for good.

Reclaim stands down while a control stop/restart is in flight:
taskqueue.control requeues those tasks itself without charging an attempt.
The stand-down is bounded by QUEUE_CONTROL_ACTION_WINDOW_SECONDS (how long the
action may take), and only actions that STOP workers suspend it. One listener's
FAIL does not end it, because SUCCESS is the only answer that means every
listener finished.

Runs in every worker container; a single pg_try_advisory_lock elects one
winner per cycle. Reclaim runs every few seconds; the slow half (stale inline
rows, migration handshakes, terminal shared payloads) only when due. After a
Postgres restart the first cycle is skipped so live workers can retake their
locks.

Main Features:
* reclaim_orphans requeues or fails RUNNING tasks whose advisory lock died
  with their worker, deferring to an in-flight control-plane action instead
* fail_stale_inline_rows finishes task rows left RUNNING by a web process
  that stopped, skipping any protected migration handshake task
* nudge_wedged_main_tasks covers the one case reclaim cannot: a main task whose
  worker is ALIVE but stopped making progress, which holds its advisory lock and
  so blocks every other main task forever. Cancelling it ends that worker's tree;
  reclaim then requeues the task and it resumes from its persisted progress - or,
  on its last attempt, fails it, which still frees the queue. It stands down for
  an in-flight control action for the same reason reclaim does. The cancel is a
  NOTIFY, and reaching stop_hard needs the worker's listener thread to run Python:
  native code holding the GIL never gets there, so a row still silent at
  _ESCALATE_AFTER x the limit has ignored it (the notify kills a worker that can
  hear it within seconds) and its worker's BACKENDS are terminated instead. That
  drops the connection holding the advisory lock, which is what actually frees the
  queue, and the worker dies on its next statement. The escalation is decided from
  the ROW's silence, which the one wedged_main_tasks query already returns, not
  from remembering last pass: any container may win the election, so per-process
  memory would only escalate when the same one won twice.
  Without it the same useless NOTIFY re-fired every cycle forever
* Every retention step runs inside its own guard. They share one connection, so
  before the guards a single failure in any of them skipped the rest of the
  cycle, dropped the connection, and burnt one more cycle on the reconnect's
  settling skip. A lost connection still propagates - that one IS the drop
* run_cycle elects one maintenance winner per pass and runs reclaim plus the
  slower retention sweeps only when they are due
* reclaim_blob_space VACUUMs what autovacuum cannot reach, because its threshold
  counts ROWS and a table of a few huge blobs never gets near it. Plain VACUUM
  only, so readers and writers are never blocked; it stands down while a task is
  live or another session holds an old transaction (a backup's pg_dump), and a
  lock_timeout means it never queues behind anyone. run_cycle does NOT call it
* start_blob_reclaim_thread runs that hourly sweep in the web process as a
  daemon thread on its own connection; a restore stops Flask before psql
  replaces the database, so the thread is already dead before the restore takes
  its ACCESS EXCLUSIVE locks, and a failed pass reconnects for the next one
