"""Flask blueprint for database backup and restore.

Serves the `/backup` UI and drives `pg_dump`/`psql` against the configured
Postgres instance, coordinating with `restart_manager` to bounce the app and
workers around a restore.

Main Features:
* Routes: `/backup` page, `/api/backup/create`, `/api/backup/download/<filename>`,
  `/api/backup/restore`.
* Connects exactly like the rest of the app: `pg_dump`/`psql` are handed
  `config.DATABASE_URL`, with the password moved into PGPASSWORD so it never
  reaches argv or the restore log.
* Serializes restores with a self-releasing lock FILE (a restore replaces the
  database, so the lock cannot live in it) that fails closed: only a lock that is
  absent, or readable and older than the TTL, lets a new restore start, while one
  that cannot be read counts as held. It also
  strips the PG17+ `SET transaction_timeout` prologue line that PG15/16 reject.
* The restore runs detached, so `/api/backup/restore` answers "started" long
  before the outcome is known. The runner appends a `RESTORE-RESULT:` marker to
  its log for whoever reads it; nothing polls it. The page counts down and
  reloads, because a restart is a restart and not a state to poll.
* A dump is restored exactly as it was taken. The backup saves everything and the
  restore restores everything, including the task rows, because the queue IS
  `task_status`: nothing here filters, rewrites or finishes what came back.
* The stop and start requests around a restore wait the whole control-action
  window, not the ack-wait budget: the workers must be provably down before psql
  replaces the database under them, and reporting "they did not confirm" while
  they are still legitimately stopping aborts a restore that was going fine.
* Backups are compressed to .zip; restore accepts .sql or .zip uploads
  (zip detected by magic bytes and extracted before psql).

      Acquires a 1-hour file lock (`BACKUP_DIR/.restore.lock`) to prevent

      - A single full upload (no `chunk_num`/`total_chunks` form fields).
      - A chunked upload where each request carries one 1 GB chunk plus the
        chunk index. Chunks are saved into `BACKUP_DIR/chunks/` and reassembled
        when the last chunk arrives. The first chunk wipes any leftover chunks
        from a previous attempt.

      When all data has been received, a detached subprocess runs psql with
      `--single-transaction` and `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` against the configured
      Postgres database, then restarts the local Flask service. A .zip upload
      (detected by magic bytes) is extracted to the inner .sql before replay.
