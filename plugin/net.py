"""Shared HTTP download helper for the plugin subsystem.

One SSRF-guarded, size-capped downloader used by both the plugin blueprint
(catalog/manifest fetches) and the plugin manager (package re-downloads) so the
guard, headers, timeouts, and size enforcement can never drift between the two.

Main Features:
* validate_outbound_url SSRF guard, User-Agent, and split connect/read timeouts from config.
* Streamed body assembled with bytearray (linear, not quadratic) and aborted past the byte cap.
* A fresh requests.Session per call so concurrent catalog-fan-out threads never share one Session.
* Network/HTTP failures raised as DownloadError with a clean, traceback-free message for the UI.
* Automatic retries with exponential backoff, because GitHub's raw/Fastly and release
  CDNs drop connections and rate-limit (429); connection errors, timeouts, and 429/5xx
  are retried per config.PLUGIN_HTTP_RETRIES instead of failing on the first hiccup.
* IPv4-first by default (config.PLUGIN_HTTP_FORCE_IPV4) because raw.githubusercontent.com
  is often unreachable over IPv6 from a container whose pod has an IPv6 address but no
  IPv6 egress (Errno 101); pinning outbound sockets to IPv4 avoids the broken AAAA path.
  Set the flag false on IPv6-only hosts.
* Automatic mirror fallback: when raw.githubusercontent.com does not reply, the same
  file is retried from the cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh mirror (a different CDN network), so
  catalog fetches and plugin downloads survive networks where Fastly is slow or filtered.
